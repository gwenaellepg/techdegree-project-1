        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>After having tried different studies, International Law and Cultural Studies, I fell on the practice of coding thanks to a couple of friends. I am really iinterested in understanding and applying the intricacies of coding to participate in the creation of succesful websites.</p>
        <p>I have never really fallen into technologies as a child but I am someone who likes and need logic, and as soon as I started getting interested in coding it made quite sense to me. I am ready and excited to face new challenges in this new path of my life.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals are to expand my knowledge as far as I can tobe able to work efficiently and neatly, to render clients with clean, aesthetic and intereactive websites. After learning about HTML, CSS and Javascript, I would like to dive into Python.</p>
